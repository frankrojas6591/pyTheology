# pyTheology
Fun excercise to describe theology in python code.  This respository serves 2 purposes:

- learning python (basic and object oriented programming)
- exploring theological concept: santification

### Why Python
Python is one of the easiest programming languages, and one that encapsulates within itself diversity and the potential to include code as complex as they come. While there are a number of projects and tutorials on beginner-friendly Python-based coding, in this github, we will learn to build a simple program in Python describing a theological (religious) concept. 

## Understanding the Project Requirements

The project seeks to describe theological (religion) process of `santification` as a python program in a very simple form.  The project is based on describing how santification works for `a given person passing judgement on some event in their life`.

- Theology: `Santification Simple` - simple python 
- Theology: `Santification Differences` -show difference views of santification  [FUTURE]
- Theology: `Santification Modeling Humanity` - complex timeline model of humanity [FUTURE]

The `santification.py` describes a very basic outline of `Santification Simple` program. 

**BACKGROUND**:
The project was concieved as a response to a discussion on an article about Catholic schools.  Specifically, the 3rd bullet in response to a comment about the article.  The sequence of points from the discussion are offered here. 
1. Article on Schools was posted
2. I made a point to disagree with the describing modern day distractions as "tyranny of technology" and inferring it as a negative `Catholic thing`.
3. My sister replied with the following:

-----
Not a Catholic” thing but an innately human and I would argue necessary thing.  The “positive” flow of energy can only be discerned (judged) as positive in light of its opposite or negative.  Light is only knowable when we “see” the dark and experience the absence of light. 

1. This ability to see light and dark, positive and negative, good and bad is built in to the way we were created in the image and likeness of God who is the just judge. 

2. We are given this capacity so that we can exercise the gift of freedom given to all in the hopes that we would see and be like God (true wisdom) 

3. **That’s the `Catholic thing` - to exercise `judgemen`t as an extension of our God-given gifts of `reason` and `intellect` so that it becomes a tool for our `sanctification` and the establishment of the `Kingdom` here in `earth` as it is in `heaven`.** (Which is the virtue of `Prudence`)

4. To deny or refuse to acknowledge the negative flow is blindness - the kind that Josie was lamenting about in the current situation regarding the dangers of mass shootings in schools.`

## Flowchart 

[!img santification.jpeg]

#### Step 1: Defining basic element and objects of the event
The first step in coding this `Theological Santification Project` is to define the core objects of the santifcation process.  See wording from #3 `The Catholic thing` above. 

- GOD (person, infinite)
- persons (person, finite)
  - reason (thing, ie. data)
  - intellect (thing, ie. data)
- judgement (thing, ie. data; God's and Human)
- pruedence (thing, ie. data)
- kingdom (place, act of entering, as the goal of santification)
- event (thing, ie. data)

#### Step 2: Ask user to describe an event

## Step 3: Person passes judgement on the event

## Step 4: Assess the human judgement 

## Step 5: Record the human judgement 
- add to santification history
- add to person's intellect history
- add to person's reasonng history

## Step 6: Repeat more events

## Step 7: Death, God's judgement 
- calculate santification score for enterance into the kingdom

## Conclusion

We have successfully completed the judgement of an event by a person and recorded that judgement into the person's enterence criteria into the Kingdom.
